## How to use the example script

#### the most convenient way (because this will provide you with the correct directory setup and helper scripts)

-   fork this repository to your own GitHub account
-   clone your forked repository to your local machine
-   open the file [qualtrics-automation.Rproj](qualtrics-automation.Rproj) with RStudio
-   within this R Project you open the [qualtrics-automation.qmd](qualtrics-automation.qmd) Quarto file. Now you can adapt the code snippets and try it out on your own machine

#### the simple way

-   download the [qualtrics-automation.qmd](qualtrics-automation.qmd) file and the helper files [write-date.R](scrips/write-date.R) and [write-survey.R](scripts/write-survey.R) directly from Github and create your own local R Project
